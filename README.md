**GitBook** is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs.

We want to help **teams to work more efficiently**🤝by creating a simple but yet powerful service for them to **share their knowledge**.

Our mission is to make a **user-friendly** and **collaborative** product for everyone to create, edit and share knowledge through documentation.
